## Interfaces

Interfaces can be utilized to abstract the input and output of your redstone mechanics to facilitate interaction with scripts. An interface is a row of target blocks (or a sole target block if you want), which can be created either with the wand item and a command or with scripts. By using the interfaces, redstone power can be received and emitted through these target blocks, with the carried data being forwarded to scripts outside the game through the mod.

## Scripts

Scripts can read or write interfaces or respond to specific events (e.g. gametick, data change). See [docs/Scripts.md](./Scripts.md).

## Commands

All commands provided by the mod require at least permission level 2 (configurable).
